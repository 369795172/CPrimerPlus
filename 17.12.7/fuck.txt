Is there any difference between kill one person or two?
Is it just a matter of numbers or something bigger?
Or have we learnt any thing from all those dead and killed?
It seems all in vain to me, at last.
We never learn, we just repeat our mistakes over and over again.
So sad, so ignorant.
But that is who we are, human beings.
